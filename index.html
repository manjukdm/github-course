    <h2> What is Git and why we use it? </h2>
    <article> Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
In simple terms, Git is a tool that tracks changes to your files over time, allowing you and others to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. </article>
